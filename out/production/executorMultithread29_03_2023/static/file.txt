If the precision of the basic integer and floating-point types is not sufficient,
you can turn to a couple of handy classes in the java.math package: BigInteger
and BigDecimal. These are classes for manipulating numbers with an arbitrarily
long sequence of digits. The BigInteger class implements arbitrary-precision
integer arithmetic, and BigDecimal does the same for floating-point numbers.

Listing 3.6 shows a modification of the lottery odds program of Listing 3.5,
updated to work with big numbers. For example, if you are invited to participate in a lottery in which you need to pick 60 numbers out of a possible
490 numbers, you can use this program to tell you your odds of winning.
